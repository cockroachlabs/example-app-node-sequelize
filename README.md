# hello-world-node-sequelize

This repo has a "Hello World" Node.js application that uses the [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/index.html) driver to talk to a temporary local CockroachDB cluster.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb-sequelize.html).
